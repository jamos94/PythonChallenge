dictionaries are similar to lists however they allow a variable to have a definition. 
they can be used by importing into a file for reference. 
consider an actual dictionary:
    - word : definition -- > key : value
    - programming dictionaries are similar. 

programming_dictionary = {"Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.", "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again."}

dictionaries can be reformatted with each definition on a new line with a indentation of 4 spaces as such:
programming_dictionary = {
    "Bug": "An error in a program that prevents the program from running as expected.", 
    "Function": "A piece of code that you can easily call over and over again.", 
}
-  end each defintion with comma to add definitions easily

RETRIEVAL : 
print(programming_dictionary["Function"])
- this is case sensitive
- ensure the correct data type is being used or an error will occur

CREATE:
programming_dictionary["Loop"] = "The action of doing something over and over again."
print(programming_dictionary) # it will display all entries included the "Loop"

CREATE EMPTY:
empty_dictionary = {}

CLEAR:
programming_dictionary = {}

edit an item:
programming_dictionary["Bug"] = "A moth in a computer"
- if nothing is the index, a new item will be created

LOOP THROUGH:
for key in programming_dictionary:
    print(key) #prints only key 

for key in programming_dictionary:
    print(key)
    print(programming_dictionary[key]) # prints the key and value
