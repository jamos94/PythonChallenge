QUICK REFRESHER (:

- we use functions every day to complete programs while coding
   - for a list of python functions: docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

We've used built-in functions but what about creating our own?

def --> definition

def my_function():  
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")

- running code at this point, nothing will happen. the function must be called
- call the function after the definition or it will not recognize it

my_function() <-- "calling" function

def my_function():
    #do this
    #then do this
    #finally this (:

- functions allows us to bundle instructions together!

--> INDENTAION
- all code that is indented inside a function is included (like a loop or if/for statement)
- think about a file inside of a folder. Each file inside a folder are indented 
    - if a file is pulled from a folder it is independent of the folder

--> spaces or tabs? 
    - for python --> SPACES ! 
        - four spaces between indentation
